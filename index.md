## Reduce Household Food Waste

Reduce, Reuse, Reheat is a one-hour workshop aimed at helping consumers reduce their household food waste outcomes.

The workshop includes four modules: an introduction to food waste and its impacts, strategies for reducing household food waste, relevant resources, and a group discussion.

All information presented comes from a scholarly literature review on food waste completed by a Master of Science student in the field of Sustainable Food Systems. You can expect to learn about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of food waste; as well as household management strategies for mitigating waste via food planning, shopping, storage, preparation, and consumption.
